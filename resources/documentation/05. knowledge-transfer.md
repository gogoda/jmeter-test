# Knowledge Transfer Documentation
This document is curated by Red Hat for ThyssenKrupp and contains information on how a development resources can prepare for work in on the service sight rules team. The primary technologies are Red Hat BRMS, Apache Jmeter, and Cucumber.

## Repository Documentation
The git repository can be found at: https://github.com/TkeITMobility/service-sight-rules
The readme file contains the documentation for the project.

### Exploration
Now that you have a general idea of how the rules operate, see if you can complete some of the quick tasks below. You should discard all changes after completing each of the tasks.

* Modify one of the scoring rules so that 10,000 is added to the score when the rule is fired. Update the associated cucumber tests and verify that they work as expected.
* Modify the verification rules for scoring located in the configuration rule file.
* Add a parameter to the Maintenance object and create a new rule that sets a value to that new variable.

### Review
After reviewing the repository, you should be able to answer the following.

Documentation:

* How are the rules invoked?
* What is the signature for the endpoint?
* What are the required headers and why are they important?
* Describe the various aspects of the JSON request.
* What is the “processId” in a request and how does it correlate to the rules?
* Describe the different POJOs that are used.
* Describe the key parts of the JSON response.

Repository:

* Where are the rules located?
* Where are the processes located?
* Describe the flow of each process (scoring, maintenance, duration). Don’t forget about the configuration rules.
* How are the rules tested?
* What do the rules look like once they are converted? We will get to this shortly.

## Red Hat BRMS Documentation

The BRMS documentation can be found at: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_BRMS/6.3/html/Development_Guide/chap_about_this_guide.html

This documentation is written for people who write rules and is strongly recommended.

### Key Sections

Here are some very important sections that should be reviewed. Each one of these sections has been listed because it is directly applicable to this project.

These sections offer additional information on how BRMS works and contain information that will be useful in the future.

### Review

After reviewing the repository, you should be able to answer the following.

* What is a fact?
* Describe the various parts to a rule written in drools.
* Describe the options available for defining a sequence for rules. Which ways are discouraged? Why?
* Describe the various parts of a rule when it is written in a spreadsheet format (.xls file).
* How is the response returned when a request is made to the rules, and the rules have completed? In the tests, there is a file that can help describe this process: https://github.com/TkeITMobility/service-sight-rules/blob/master/src/test/java/com/tke/servicesight/rules/service/RulesService.java
* How can you find overlapping rules?
* How do you use the audit trail in JBDS to debug rules?

## Cucumber Tests in Java
Cucumber is used for all of the unit tests. Documentation for Cucumber can be found here: https://cucumber.io/docs/reference. Additional documentation for creating tests for a Java application can be found here: https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm. It may also be necessary to search for tutorials that explain how to use cucumber with java. Ex) https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cucumber/index.htm

## Key Sections
 * Gherkin
   * https://cucumber.io/docs/reference#gherkin
 * Step definition
   * In Gherkin: https://cucumber.io/docs/reference#step-definitions
   * Associated Java: https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm#step-definitions

## Review
 * How can you limit which tests are run?
 * How are the PoJos created?
 * What executes the rules?

## Apache Jmeter

The Apache Jmeter documentation can be found at: http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html

### Documentation Key Sections

Here are some important sections that should be reviewed. Each one of these sections has been listed because it is directly applicable to this project.

 * Installation
   * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#install
 * Running Jmeter
   * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#running
 * Thread Groups
   * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#thread_group
 * Listeners
   * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#listeners
 * Assertions
   * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#assertions
 * Web Test Plan
   * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/build-web-test-plan.html

### Exploration of .JMX file
Now that you have an idea of how Jmeter works and how the elements function, begin to explore the raw XML of the .jmx file. There is a program that generates this file, so don't get lost in the over 50,000 lines. Get a general understanding of the structure and then begin to explore the program that generates the file.

See if you can identify the following
 * Locate the Test Plan and the associated configuration elements.
 * Identify the Thread Groups and the associated configuration elements.
   * Search for "ThreadGroup"
 * Locate the JSON request for one of the HTTP Samplers.
   * Search for something that is found in a JSON request.
 * Identify an assertion and the associated configuration elements
   * Search for "ResponseAssertion"
 * Locate the configuration test elements and their configuration elements.
   * Search for "ConfigTestElement"

### Further Reading
There are quite a few small sections that would be good to review. Just a few are listed here

  * Configuration elements
    * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#config_elements
  * Post Processors
    * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#postprocessors
  * Execution Order
    * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#executionorder
  * Advanced Web Test Plan
    * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/build-adv-web-test-plan.html
  * Header Manager
    * http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/build-adv-web-test-plan.html#header_manager

### Review
After reviewing the documentation and the JMX file, answer the following.

GUI for Jmeter:
 * Where are the configurations located for making an HTTP request?
 * Where is the JSON body located for one of the requests?
 * Where is the associated assertion for that test?
 * What happens if you change an assertion and then run the rules?
 * Walk through the elements found in the results tree.

## Cucumber to Jmeter program
At this point you should have a good idea of the structure of the JMX file. The Cucumber to Jmeter program may need to be updated as change are made to the rules.

### Exploration
The program is located in /resources/apps/cucumber-jmeter. Follow the instructions located in the <a href='/resources/documentation/04. resources.md#resources'>resources chapter</a> for setting up the application. After exploring the code, see of you can answer the following questions.

 * How are the cucumber files found in the repository?
 * How are the cucumber files converted in to POJOs?
 * What is the importance of the keyMap in the ExtractData class?
 * Where is the Test Plan declared?
 * Where are Thread Groups declared?
 * How are the HTTP requests constructed?
 * How are the assertions constructed?
 * Where is the URL, PORT, and request type being set?
